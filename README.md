# MMLDS_project
This repo contains the complementary code for our project for the lecture in MMLDS about comparing SINDy, NODEs and ESNs.

We ran experiments on Lorenz data and Sea Surface Temperature measurements for the El Ni√±o Soutern Oscillation. The dataset can be found here: [https://psl.noaa.gov/data/help/](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.cobe2.html)
